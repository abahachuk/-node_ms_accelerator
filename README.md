Node MS Accelerator
=========

Getting started
---------------

Download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview). If you are on Mac or Windows, [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) will be automatically installed. On Linux, make sure you have the latest version of [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Run in this directory:
```
docker-compose up
```
The app will be running at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

Alternately, if you want to run it on a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), first make sure you have a swarm. If you don't, run:
```
docker swarm init
```
Once you have your swarm, in this directory run:
```
docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-stack.yml node_mc_accelerator
```

Alternately, if you want to create multi-service and multi-node application, follow instruction [Docker Stack](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part5/)
